# Resource Allocation Formula for the Health Sector

This repository contains codes related to the implementation of a Resource Allocation Formulae for intra-governmental fiscal transfers. 

## Files

* The PPT contains a background on the rationale behind revising the resource allocation formula as well as visual representations of of the implications of different theoretical options available. 

* The python code allows for a generalisable manipulation of data to set up for analysis on python as well as defines a function to carry out pace of change simulations based on flexible inputs provided on initial budget, growth rate, and targeted budget distritbution.
