# Resource Allocation Formula for the Health Sector

This repository contains codes related to the implementation of a Resource Allocation Formulae for intra-governmental fiscal transfers. 
The work was done as part of the ongoing efforts to finalise the revision of the resource allocation formula to equitably distribute the 
health sector budget to districts in Malawi. 

## Files

* The PPT contains a background on the rationale behind revising the resource allocation formula as well as visual representations of of the implications of different theoretical options available. 

* The python code allows for a generalisable manipulation of data to set up for analysis on python as well as defines a function to carry out pace of change simulations based on flexible inputs provided on initial budget, growth rate, and targeted budget distritbution.
